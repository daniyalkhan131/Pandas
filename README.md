# Pandas

there are many datastructure in pandas unlike numpy where only nd array was there
two main datastructures-
dataframe (it is the full table)
series (it is row or column of table)
series have two things index and values while dataframe have rows and columns

it is important to reduce memory footprint of data like if flot column given and values can be int so convert it into int so reduce memory.
